Eventy
======

_**Easy-to-use event-loop dispatcher framework for D-based applications**_

## Getting started

Eventy can easily be added to any D project that used DUB to maintain dependencies with
the following command:

```
dub add eventy
```

Once added you should then head over to the [Quick start](quick_start) section to figure out how you
can get a small little program up and running that makes use of the event-and-signal
handling system that Eventy provides.
