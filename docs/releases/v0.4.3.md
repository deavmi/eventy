Release v0.4.3
==============

Completely overhauled Eventy system for the v0.4.0 release

Removed the event-loop for a better system (for now) whereby we just dispatch signal handlers on the call to `push(Event)`.

In a future release I hope to bring the event loop back but in a signal-based manner, such that we can support deferred events and priorities and such
